Introduction on using GitHub
Hi, I am new on GitHub and want to make the most of it. I love programming and currently training as a financial engineer. I hope to learn from and contribute to in my experience on this platform. My areas of interest now in terms of programming languages are pyhton, R, C# and Java. PHP as well.JS is also cool.
